      "question": "A large international financial institution (FI) operates extensively in both the US and EU. Recently, the bank was involved in a complex cross-border transaction involving a high-net-worth client with dual citizenship in the US and France. The transaction, intended to transfer funds between accounts in New York and Paris, raised red flags due to the involvement of a third-party intermediary from a high-risk jurisdiction. During an internal review, compliance officers identified discrepancies in how the transaction was reported to regulators in both the US and EU In the US, the transaction fell under the purview of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions lists. In the EU, the transaction was subject to the 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (6AMLD) and the regulations enforced by the European Banking Authority (EBA). What is the best approach for the compliance team to ensure compliance with ant-financial crime (AFC) regulations and the requirements of the main regulatory bodies in both the US and the EU for this transaction?",
